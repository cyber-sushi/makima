#SAMPLE CONFIG FILE FOR A GENERIC MOUSE
#Put this in ~/.config/makima and rename it to the exact name of the device as shown by the 'evtest' command, including spaces and capitalization. Omit "/" if present.
#You can find the available keycodes in /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h
#If you're not sure which keycode corresponds to which key, you can run 'evtest', select your device and press the corresponding key/button.
#Relative and absolute axis events are hard coded, for example use SCROLL_WHEEL_UP and SCROLL_WHEEL_DOWN to rebind wheel movements.

#Keep in mind that if you want to use Modifiers across multiple devices (e.g. KEY_LEFTCTRL on your keyboard and BTN_RIGHT on your mouse), both devices will have to be read by Makima and thus both will need a config file, even if empty. Having a config file is just a way to tell Makima "Hey, read this device!".

If you declare a binding that uses a non-modifier key as a modifier in the [remap] or [commands] sections, it's automatically added to this setting.
